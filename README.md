# DnD-Themed Software Portfolio

This repository is a Dungeons & Dragons–inspired software portfolio that showcases small web apps, tools, and components themed around tabletop RPG mechanics. Projects are implemented with modern JavaScript tooling and demonstrate UI design, game-like logic, AI/ML experiments, and embedded systems work.

## What you'll find here

- A collection of projects and demos (see the projects listing in data/portfolio.json).
- A hero page and themed UI components built with Next.js to present projects as "quests" and "loot".
- Examples that highlight backend systems, AI/ML prototypes, hardware integrations, and frontend experiences (procedural content generators, character UIs, encounter helpers, etc.).
- A data-driven structure so new projects can be added by updating JSON entries.

## Highlights

- Narrative presentation: projects presented as quests with rarity and loot values.
- Hands-on demos: code for machine learning experiments, real-time hand tracking, assistive hardware prototypes, and gameplay AI.
- Emphasis on reusability: modular components and a simple data model (see data/portfolio.json) that drives the site.

## Project structure (important locations)

- app/ — Next.js pages and UI composition.
- data/portfolio.json — canonical list of projects, hero, skills, and contact info used by the site.
- components/ — reusable UI components (cards, lists, hero).
- public/ — images and static assets used in the portfolio.

## Explore the portfolio

- Browse data/portfolio.json to review how projects are represented (fields like name, rarity, technologies, and lootValue).
- Open app/ and components/ to see how the data is rendered into themed UI pages.
- Each project in the data file links to source or demos where available.
